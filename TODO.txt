√ bootstrap entrypoints
√ bootstrap commands

- $environment/vee-linked.txt reports on what is already linked in there

- abtract GitRepo class for wrapping a git repo and working directory
    - GitRepo(working_dir, remote_url=None)
        - clones if it doesn't exist
    - GitRepo.checkout(revision, fetch=True, clean=False, hard=True, force=False)

- custom managers
    - PyAV has special build instructions

- file manager

- pip manager
    - can we vendor pip?
        see: https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py


- We need some sort of builds/index.db in order to find existing builds.

  SQLite schema:

    migrations: lift this from my web projects

    builds:
        
        - id
        - cache_path
        - build_path
        - created_at
        - user_specification (normalized via Package.__str__)
        - manager (without options)
        - package (without options)

        Below can be provided by the user, but also discovered at build time.
        package.setattr('version', version, specificity=4) # stores the highest specificity
            _version_specificity stores the current specificity

        - name (defaults to $package)
        - version
        - revision
        - commit (do we need this, or can we overload revision?)

- `vee clone` for dev?

- symlink directories if they aren't going to contain anything but one
  requirement's files; match how Homebrew does it

- Requirement --configuration flag for flags to pass to things when they are
  configured. Homebrew could use this for `brew install $name $configuration`

- Homebrew is only installing the tree of the one package, not any of the
  dependencies. It should also link the dependencies. Perhaps there should be
  a Requirements.iter_dependencies() which returns them all, and then makes
  sure they are all linked.

- Packages need to identify what they provide, so that others can depend on them.
    
    homebrew+ffmpeg provides "lib:ffmpeg" and "bin:ffmpeg". PyAV needs "lib:ffmpeg":

    PKG_CONFIG_PATH = home.absbuild('lib:ffmpeg', 'lib', 'pkg-config')

- Document the various *_name, *_path, and *() methods of the install pipeline.

    - Requirement.specification -> normalized specification

    - Requirement.manager_name
    - Requirement.manager -> Manager that transports, and likely does the build

    - Requirement.fetch() -> uses the Manager to get the package
    - Requirement.package -> or string path

    - Requirement.build() -> uses the Manager to build
      Requirement.build_path

    - Requirement.install() -> uses the Manager to install.
    - Requirement.artifact -> string path

    - Environment.link(requirement)


- homebrew taps: homebrew+mikeboers/testbrew/foo
    - we would need a way to detect which tap it is
    - we can grep `brew info $forumla` for From: https://github.com/#{user}/#{repo}/blob/master/#{path}


- commands

    vee init REPO
    vee update
    vee upgrade

    √ vee install REQUIREMENT
    - vee install -r requirements.txt
    √ vee link NAME REQUIREMENTS_FILE
